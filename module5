#Before starting these exercises, you will need to run the fixGenerator.sh script using the steps below: Open the file using this link: fixGenerator.sh. Copy the contents of this file to your computer's clipboard. Connect to your Linux instance and run the following commands: Change to your home directory: cd ~
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cd ~
# Open vim and create a new file: vi fixGenerator.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ vi fixGenerator.sh
# Tap i to enter editing mode. Right-click the empty window to paste the copied text into the file. Tap Esc to switch to command mode. Type :x to exit vim. Update the permissions on the new file: chmod 744 fixGenerator.sh
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ chmod 744 fixGenerator.sh
# Run the script: ./fixGenerator.sh &
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ ./fixGenerator.sh &
# The script will run in the background and create a log file named fixlog that we can use for the following exercises:
#1. Using the cat command, display the contents of the script you ran to the screen.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cat fixGenerator.sh
#2. Use the cat command to display the contents of the script you ran to the screen but with line numbers.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cat -n fixGenerator.sh
#3. Read the contents of the log file created using cat but direct it to a new file in your home directory named newlog.log
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cat fixlog20220722120987.log > newlog.log (Q: why fixlog has no?)
#4. Create a directory named logs
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ mkdir logs
#5. Move the newlog.log into the logs directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ mv newlog.log ./logs/
#6. Cat the original log file you created again. This time, append its output to the newlog.log file you just moved.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cat fixlog20220722120987.log >> ./logs/newlog.log
#7. Create a soft link named Daily to your newlog.log file in the logs directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ ln -s ./logs/newlog.log Daily
#8. Return to your home directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cd ~
#9. Cat the original fix log file created into a less so that you can browse the file.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ less fixlog20220722120987.log #or cat fix... | less
#10. Using the search function in less, look for any new order messages. (You may need to refer back to your fix training to look up the appropriate fix tag.)
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ vi fix20220722120987.log #then type in vi editor /35=8 to search
#11. Exit less and run a search using grep for all new order messages. Redirect the output to a file named newOrders.log in the logs directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cat fix20220722120987.log | grep '35=8' > ./logs/newOrders.log
#12. Copy the newOrders.log file from the logs directory to your home directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cp newOrders.log /home/ubuntu
#13. Run a command to find out how many lines are in the newOrders.log file.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ wc -l newOrders.log
#14. Run a command to pull out all of the messages with the instruction buy in fix (you may need to look up the tag again) from the original log file and put them into a new log file in the logs directory named buyMessages.log
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cat fix20220722120987.log | grep '35=0' > ./logs/buyMessages.log
#15. Count how many lines are in that file.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ wc -l buyMessages.log
#16. Count how many new orders are in the buyMessages.log.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ wc buyMessages.log
#17. Create a new version of the logfile named noNewOrders.log that has everything except new order messages in it and put it in the logs directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cat buyMessages.log | grep -L '35=8' > ./logs/noNewOrders.log
#18. Count how many words are in the noNewOrders.log.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ wc noNewOrders.log
#19. Show the last 5 lines of the noNewOrders.log to the screen.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ tail -n 5 noNewOrders.log
#20. Find all the messages relating to Apple in the original log file and show the first two lines to the screen.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cat fix20220722120987.log | grep "AAPL" | head -n 2
#21. Add a soft link named fix to your fixGenerator script.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ ln -s fixGenerator.sh fix
#22. Tail the log file created looking for new orders only in your tail command. (This will not actually cause any updates to the screen because the log file is not currently being updated.)
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ tail fix20220722120987.log | grep '35=8'
#23. Create a new directory named superLogs
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ mkdir superLogs
#24. Copy everything in the logs directory into the superLogs directory.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cp ./logs/ ./superLogs
#25. Run a single grep command with an option on grep to count the number of messages for FB in the original log file that was created.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cat fix20220722120987.log | grep "FB" | wc
#26. Count the number of words in the original logfile.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ wc fix20220722120987.log
#27. Find the number of new order messages for Netflix in the original log file.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-16-54:~$ cat fix20220722120987.log | grep "NLFX" | wc
