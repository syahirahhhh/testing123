#1. Create a variable named TEXT with the value "The number is "
TEXT=”The number is “

#2. Write a for loop that prints numbers 1-25 after printing the value of TEXT each time.
for i in {1..25}; do echo $TEXT $i; done

#3. Run the same command, this time redirecting the output to a file named forloop.out.
for i in {1..25}; do echo $TEXT $i; done > forloop.out

#4. Write a sed command that creates a new output file from forloop.out where instead of saying "the number is ", it will now say "the number is not ". Name the file forloop2.out
sed ‘s/the number is/the number is not/g’ forloop.out > forloop2.out

#5. Try running the following if statement to get familiar with it:
i=1
if(( $i==1 ))
then
echo "i is equal to 1"
elif(($i==2))
then
echo "i is equal to 2"
else
echo "i is neither 1 or 2"
fi

#6. Change the value of i to be something not 1 or 2 and check that the statement works again.
# statement works and outputs “i is neither 1 or 2”

#7. Create a variable of today's date named TODAY in the format of DD.MM.YYYY.
TODAY=`date +%d.%m.%Y` 

#8. Create another variable named GENDATE that has the command to generate and store the same date.
GENDATE=$TODAY

#9. Create a file named output.log with today’s date as an extension using the variable you just created.
touch output.log.$GENDATE

#Additional questions:
#1. Create a script to summarize available disk space and present in a logical and readable fashion
vi diskspace.sh
# in vi editor, df -h | awk '{ print $1,$4 }', then esc then :x
chmod 777 diskspace.sh
./diskspace.sh
